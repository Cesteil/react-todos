# Getting Started

If you have not already, fork this repo and clone it. Run `npm install` to install npm packages and `npm start` to run the project.

## Initial Data

Example initial data for this app for the `currentItem` (an object) is 

> {
>   name: ''
> }

and for the list of `todos` (an array of objects) is

> [
>   { name: 'laundry' },
>   { name: 'buy groceries' },
>   { name: 'mow lawn' }
> ]

## Refactor

Refactor to use the appropriate React Hook to get this to work. During this refactor, the following hooks may make their way into the project: `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, and/or `useEffect`.
